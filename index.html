                on <span class="black">github</span>, your profile contributions graph is a record of contributions you've made to github repositories - commits, pull requests, code reviews, issue reporting, etc. contributions are only counted if they meet certain criteria. among those criteria is not the signicance of your contribution, just that it happened. a pull request for a crucial bug fix holds the same weight as a pull request as a cosmetic typo. 
            </p>
            <p class="f5 f3-ns code">
                <span class='gold'> git commitment</span> unsuccessfully quantifies the contributions you make not to code repositories, but to your relationships. acts of care, emotional investment, expressions of compassion, empathy, and intimacy - your commitment - can only be counted in discrete increments. <span class="gold"> git commitment </span> cannot weigh the signficance of any 'contribution' to your relationships - only that they happened. something like saying <span class="dark-red">i love you ️️❤️</span> might just be one contribution - whether it was a heartfelt full-throated expression of genuine love, or an automatic response to signify the end of a phone call. are you performing as part of an automated process, or genuinely emoting?
            </p>
            <p class="f5 f3-ns code">
                what qualifies as a 'contribution' to your relationships is something that can resist computation or quantifcation. moreover the results are self reported. <span class='gold'> git commitment</span> therefore is not just a measure of relationships, or a journal, but a report of self-worth or self importance. it may rely on the idea of the relationship as something transactional, in which you need to offer something consistently. it may not.

                    you can make your own commitment heatmap:

                <ul class='code'>
                    <p>using beaker browser, github, or the dat cli tool - fork this repository</p>
                    <p>you can edit the `dates.csv` in the repository, using excel, numbers, or any text editor. the count will represent the number of 'contributions' you've made to your relationships on the given date - how you choose to count that is up to you - there are columns for you to list your acts of care if you so choose, but these are not factored into the graph </p>
                    <p>host your modified repository at a dat link - the XMLrequest required to display the heatmap does not operate locally</p>
                    <p>if you wish to have your heatmap mirrored with http, feel free to upload your dat archive to hashbase</p>
