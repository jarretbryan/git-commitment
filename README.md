# git-commitment

on github, your profile contributions graph is a record of contributions you've made to github repositories - commits, pull requests, code reviews, issue reporting, etc. contributions are only counted if they meet certain criteria. among those criteria is not the signicance of your contribution, just that it happened. a pull request for a crucial bug fix holds the same weight as a pull request as a cosmetic typo. 

git commitment unsuccessfully quantifies the contributions you make not to code repositories, but to your relationships. acts of care, emotional investment, expressions of compassion, empathy, and intimacy - your commitment - can only be counted in discrete increments. git commitment cannot weigh the signficance of any 'contribution' to your relationships - only that they happened. something like saying 'i love you ️️❤️" might just be one contribution - whether it was a heartfelt full-throated expression of genuine love, or an automatic response to signify the end of a phone call.
